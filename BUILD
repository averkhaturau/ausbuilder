Prerequisites:
Qt framework (5.2 or later), QtCreator (bundled with Qt); you can get that 
from https://www.qt.io/download/

Build steps:
- download https://www.dropbox.com/s/5vt5p8wtucnfdjz/aude.zip and unpack the 
  contents to src/assets/aude;
- open src/ausbuilder.pro in QtCreator;
- build and run.

Supported platforms (for now): MS Windows, Linux (should work), 
MAC OS X (probably, not tested), Android (probably, but you need to add 
audio from src/assets/aude to qrc resources)
